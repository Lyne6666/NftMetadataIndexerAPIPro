# NftMetadataIndexerAPIPro

## Description

This repository hosts a novel NFT contract employing a Merkle tree-based ownership verification scheme for gas-efficient claim and transfer operations, alongside a decentralized metadata storage solution leveraging IPFS with content addressing and cryptographic pinning for enhanced immutability.

## Features

- Utilizes a distributed caching layer with Redis for low-latency metadata retrieval.
- Implements a robust event listener that captures NFT transfers and mints directly from blockchain nodes.
- Supports configurable indexing strategies, including event-based and polling mechanisms, to optimize resource consumption.
- Provides a GraphQL API endpoint for flexible and efficient querying of NFT metadata across multiple collections.
- Deploys a multi-threaded architecture with asynchronous task processing for handling high volumes of NFT transactions.
- Integrates with IPFS and Arweave gateways to resolve decentralized content URIs and ensure data persistence.
- Enables metadata enrichment through external data sources using customizable transformation pipelines.
- Maintains data integrity by performing periodic consistency checks against blockchain data and resolving discrepancies.
